# Titanic-Kaggle-Challenge
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The dataset includes a range of characteristics for each individual passenger, these include:


<b>PassengerID</b>— A column added by Kaggle to identify each row and make submissions easier

<b>Survived</b>— Whether the passenger survived or not and the value we are predicting (0 = No , 1 = Yes)

<b>Pclass</b>— The class of the ticket the passenger purchased (1 = 1st , 2 = 2nd , 3 =3rd)

<b>Sex</b>— The passenger’s sex

<b>Age</b>— The passenger’s age in years

<b>SibSp</b>— The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic

<b>Parch</b>— The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic

<b>Ticket</b>— The passenger’s ticket number

<b>Fare</b>— The fare the passenger paid

<b>Cabin</b>— The passenger’s cabin number

<b>Embarked</b>— The port where the passenger embarked (C = Cherbourg , Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)


In this Jupyter notebook, you will come across some the most common steps towards building a Machine Learning model which include:

* Importing and cleaning the data
* Exploratory data analysis through data visualisations using popular python libaries
* Feature Engineering
* Feature selection
* Modelling using a few different base models 
* Hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance  

This model achieves an <b>accuracy score</b> of *80%* evaluated by kaggle website. 


Please feel free to leave comments and suggest ways in which I could improve my solution :)
